{"name":"Drupal-launch-checklist","tagline":"Drupal Website Launch Checklist (the best practices)","body":"## Pre-launch ##\r\n- Perform load testing & optimization beforehand include slow-log analyses;\r\n  - [Percona Toolkit](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/pt-query-digest.html) for MySQL can help to analyze slow logs;\r\n- Check Drupal SEO Tools report;\r\n- Match recommendations of the following:\r\n\t- [Security Review Module](https://drupal.org/project/security_review);\r\n    - [Site Audit module](https://drupal.org/project/site_audit);\r\n    - Acquia Insight;\r\n    - YSlow;\r\n- Performance and Scalability Checklist module;\r\n- Match the requirements of Acquia Insight;\r\n- Analyze Coder Review results;\r\n- Perform load testing using tools with cleared database cache, memcache and image styles when caches are disabled;\r\n- Make sure you have a failover scenario and a quick backup;\r\n- Configure Cron jobs;\r\n- Disable all development modules;\r\n- Add console.log stub;\r\n- Configure caches properly: Varnish, Memcache;\r\n- Check if CDNs are configured correctly for live environment;\r\n- Make sure AJAX requests are cached;\r\n- Enable bandwidth optimization;\r\n    - Compress cached pages;\r\n    - Aggregate and compress JS/CSS files;\r\n        - Use [Advanced CSS/JS Aggregation](https://drupal.org/project/advagg) module instead of core aggregation;\r\n- Test simultaneous an consequent anonymous access scenarios and behavior when every cache is enabled;\r\n- Replace database logging functionality with other solutions, e.g. syslog;\r\n- Disable any errors output on frontend;\r\n- Enable fast_404 in settings.php file or use [Fast 404](https://drupal.org/project/fast_404) module;\r\n- [Make sure file permissions for file directories and code directory are set correctly](http://drupal.org/node/244924);\r\n- Make sure that input formats are correctly configured;\r\n- On /admin/config/system/site-information make sure the email address and name are correct;\r\n- Ensure website permissions are set appropriately and minimally;\r\n- Get rid of CHANGELOG.txt etc (from Git etc). Do NOT remove robots.txt;\r\n- If using SSL, change your local /etc/hosts to point the site to its live domain and ensure SSL redirection is working correctly;\r\n- Remove test content, such as \"lorum ipsum\" text, dummy users, or content generated by the Devel module;\r\n- Check the maximum file upload sizes and maximum execution time;\r\n- If you don't use core Search module, make sure it's disabled;\r\n- If you use any replacements for standard Cron, make sure it's disabled;\r\n- Warm caches before launch:\r\n    - Use [Cache Warmer module](https://drupal.org/project/cache_warmer);\r\n    - Use [HTTPRL Spider module](https://drupal.org/project/httprl_spider);\r\n- If possible, perform launch component-by-component and one-by-one;\r\n- Make sure your admin account has a strong password and it's changed before launch;\r\n- Enable caching for Views output, Panels panes output and blocks. Useful modules are the following:\r\n    - [Views Content Cache](https://drupal.org/project/views_content_cache).\r\n\r\n## Gotchas ##\r\n- If you maintain a very large number of files on your website, it can have a substantial negative effect on performance and stability, especially if they are all contained in the same directory.  If your site requires a large number of files, maintain them in multiple directories;\r\n- Using standard Views pager might cause performance issues because of additional COUNT query. Use [Views Litepager](https://drupal.org/project/views_litepager) instead.\r\n- Some conditions prevent the use of an in-memory temporary table, in which case the server uses an on-disk table instead:\r\n\t- Presence of a BLOB or TEXT column in the table;\r\n\t- Presence of any string column in a GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause larger than 512 bytes;\r\n\t- Presence of any string column with a maximum length larger than 512 (bytes for binary strings, characters for nonbinary strings) in the SELECTlist, if UNION or UNION ALL is used.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
